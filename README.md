# ISCI-Research-Projects

Final reports and selected code from Research Projects 1, 2, and 4 of the ISCI 1A24 course.

ISCI 1A24 is a year-round, 24 credit course for students in the Integrated Science program, which focuses on a research-based, multidisciplinary approach to science education. 

I was a student in the Integrated Science program in my first-year, before switching my focus to Mathematics & Statistics in my second year. Integrated Science had a strong impact on my approach to problem-solving, group projects & collaboration, and research. Overall, my first year experience was valuable and greatly influenced my current academic and career trajectory.
